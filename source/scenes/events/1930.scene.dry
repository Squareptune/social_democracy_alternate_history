The long and bloody conflict draws to a close. General Robert E. Lee, commanding the battered remnants of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, has surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant. The terms are generousâ€”officers may keep their swords, men their horses.

The guns fall silent. After four years, the Civil War is effectively over.
