= Demoblize the Army

The Army of the Potomac, once the backbone of the Union war effort, is officially disbanded on June 28. The long war has finally ended, and across the South, Confederate forces are surrendering, beaten and scattered.

The transition to peace now begins, but peace brings its own kind of uncertainty. Union soldiers return home, demobilization picks up pace, and the task of securing the South politically and socially falls more heavily on civilian authorities and local commanders.

This moment marks not just the end of hostilities â€” but the beginning of a new, difficult era.
