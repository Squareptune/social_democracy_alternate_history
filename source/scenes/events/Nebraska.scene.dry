Nebraska has officially joined the Union as the 37th state. With a predominantly rural and pro-Republican population, its admission strengthens the Radical Republican coalition in Congress.  

The territory had previously passed a constitution excluding Black suffrage, but Congress demanded its revisionâ€”marking a small victory for equality.

Let us hope this sets the standard for future state admissions.
