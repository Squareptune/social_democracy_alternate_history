= Sharecropping

President Johnson has begun appointing provisional governors across the former Confederate states. But many of these men including known secessionists and ex-Confederate officials, now hold the reins of local power under the banner of national reconciliation.

Meanwhile, in places like Texas, formerly enslaved people are attempting to assert their freedom. With few protections and little economic leverage, many find themselves trapped in exploitative contracts under the new system of "sharecropping": a rebranded form of slavery.

We watches warily. Republicans debate whether to give Johnsonâ€™s plan a chance, or to demand more thorough Reconstruction through military or legislative means.
