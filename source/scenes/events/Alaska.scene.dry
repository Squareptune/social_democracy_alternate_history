The Russian Empire has quietly offered to sell its vast territory of Alaska to the United States. Secretary of State William H. Seward is eager to accept, viewing it as a strategic and economic opportunity.

Skeptics mock the idea saying that the land is just a frozen wasteland. With Congress still embroiled in Reconstruction, many question the wisdom of spending $7 million on an icebox.

Should we proceed with this purchaseâ€”or focus our resources at home?

- @buy_alaska: Purchase Alaska for $7 million.
- @reject_alaska: Decline the offer.

We finalize the Alaska Purchase. While critics remain vocal, visionaries hail the acquisition as a step toward America's growing influence in the Pacific and Arctic. However, many question prioritizing expansion over justice at home.

We decline the offer. For now, we must focus on mending the Union. Russia expresses disappointment, but our critics applaud our restraint.
