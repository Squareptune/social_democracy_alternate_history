= National Union Convention of 1866

President Johnson’s supporters have organized the National Union Convention in Philadelphia. Their goal: to forge a new coalition between moderate Republicans, War Democrats, and loyal Southerners in support of Johnson’s lenient Reconstruction policies.

Radical Republicans see this as a betrayal of the war’s legacy and a threat to freedmen's rights. Tensions between Congress and the President are nearing a breaking point.

- @support_johnson: Endorse the Convention and back Johnson's Reconstruction.
- @oppose_johnson: Condemn the Convention and rally with the Radicals.
- @stay_neutral: Attempt to stay above the fray.

You publicly endorse the Convention’s call for reconciliation, backing Johnson’s moderate vision. While this boosts support from conservatives and War Democrats, it alienates Radical Republicans and Black constituencies.

@oppose_johnson
subtitle: Side with the Radicals
on-arrival: radical_strength += 5; conservative_dissent += 4; freedmen_rep += 5; dissent_percent -= 5;

You condemn the National Union Convention as a Trojan horse for white Southern redemption. Radicals rally to your side, but Johnson's allies begin treating you as a political enemy.

subtitle: Avoid direct involvement
on-arrival: moderate_strength += 3; conservative_dissent += 2; radical_dissent += 3; 

You express cautious support for unity while declining to take a firm stand. This appeases some moderates but frustrates activists on both sides.
