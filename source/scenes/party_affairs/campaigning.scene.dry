= Campaigning

Whether or not we are in an electoral campaign, the party is always trying to broaden its voter base. Who should we focus our campaign efforts on?

- @workers: The urban working class, our traditional support base.
- @middle_class: The middle class of professionals and businessmen.
- @rural: Rural farmers and Southern yeomanry.
- @freemen: The newly emancipated freedmen.
- @immigrant_laborers: Immigrant workers, often skeptical of Reconstruction.
- @unemployed: The unemployed.
- @root: We either don't want to or cannot campaign right now.
- @easy_discard
