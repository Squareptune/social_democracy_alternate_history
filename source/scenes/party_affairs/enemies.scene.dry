= Choosing our enemies

In our media and campaign materials, who should we consider as our main opponents?

[? if enemies != 0 : Previously, we had considered the [+ enemies +] as our prior enemies. Is a change of direction necessary? ?]

- @confederates: Former Confederates, who caused the Civil War to protect slavery.
- @KKK: New Paramilitaries found in the south. 
- @imma: The new immigrants, particularly Irish and Germans.
- @bourgeois: The elites and wealthy in society
- @easy_discard

@confederates
on-arrival: enemies = "confederates"; radical_strength += 5; moderate_strength += 5; conservative_dissent += 5; workers_dem -= 2; middle_class_rep -= 2; freemen_rep -= 2;

Aiming our focus at the former Confederates amongst our midst is popular among the entire party, although the conservative republicans are worried that we are too aggressive against a now defeated enemy.

@KKK
on-arrival: enemies = "KKK"; radical_strength += 5; radical_dissent -= 5; moderate_dissent += 5; rural_dem -= 3; unemployed_dem -= 3;

[? if kkk_strength < 10000 or year < 1867 : The southern paramilitary groups are currently small and barely have any members. Some question our choices. ?][? if kkk_strength >= 10000 or year >= 1867 : The KKK and others are the biggest obstacle for our black supporter. ?]

@imma
on-arrival: enemies = "imma"; conservative_strength += 5; workers_nsdap -= 4; immigrant_laborers_rep -= 5; workers_rep += 3;

Despite having bigger priorities at the moment, we decide to go after the immigrants who pose to steal the jobs of the northern workers.

@bourgeois
on-arrival: enemies = "bourgeois"; socialism_strength += 8; socialist_dissent -= 5; conservative_dissent += 8; workers_dem -= 3; workers_other -= 5;

Our anti-bourgeois rhetoric is popular among the workers, but these ideas are fringe and may reduce funding from our patrons.
