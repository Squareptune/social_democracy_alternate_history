= Media Strategy

The Republican Party maintains a growing network of newspapers and loyal publications throughout the Union. With our message in high demand after the war, we must decide how to wield our media power.

@commercial
title: Commercialize the Republican press
subtitle: We broaden our appeal, risking ideological clarity.
on-arrival: resources += 1; europe_relations += 1; conservative_strength += 4; moderate_strength += 2; liberal_strength += 2; radical_dissent += 5; socialism_strength -= 1; middle_class_rep += 4; immigrant_laborers_rep += 3; rural_rep += 2; workers_rep += 1

Our newspapers shift toward patriotic business owners and loyal moderates. The party brings in more funds, but radicals decry the dilution of our Reconstruction values.

@campaign
title: Focus our press on campaigning
subtitle: Target loyal Republican voters and shore up our base.
on-arrival: moderate_strength += 3; liberal_strength += 2; radical_strength += 1; conservative_strength += 1; dissent -= 2; workers_rep += 3; middle_class_rep += 2; rural_rep += 1; freemen_rep += 2

Election coverage strengthens enthusiasm among Republicans and mobilizes our base across the North and border states.

@ideological
title: Promote vibrant internal debate
subtitle: Let all factions express themselves through the press.
on-arrival: radical_dissent -= 5; moderate_dissent -= 5; conservative_dissent -= 5; liberal_dissent -= 5; workers_rep += 1; middle_class_rep += 1; freemen_rep += 1

We allow the party press to become a forum for ideas and factional debates. It risks some confusion in messaging, but tensions ease within the coalition.

@freedmen_press
title: Support Freedmenâ€™s newspapers and editors
subtitle: -1 resources
choose-if: resources >= 1
unavailable-subtitle: Not enough resources.
on-arrival: resources -= 1; radical_strength += 3; socialism_strength += 2; europe_relations += 1; liberal_strength += 1; freemen_rep += 5; rural_rep -= 1; immigrant_laborers_rep -= 1

We invest in Black-led Republican papers across the South. These serve as vital tools for political education and uplift, even under threats of violence.

@northern_press
title: Build up press networks in Northern cities
subtitle: -1 resources
choose-if: resources >= 1
unavailable-subtitle: Not enough resources.
on-arrival: resources -= 1; moderate_strength += 3; liberal_strength += 2; conservative_strength += 1; europe_relations += 1; middle_class_rep += 4; workers_rep += 2; immigrant_laborers_rep += 2

Our Northern papers emphasize peace, prosperity, and the Union cause. This strategy appeals to middle-class voters, war veterans, and businessmen.

@borderlands
title: Expand Republican messaging into border states
subtitle: -1 resources
choose-if: resources >= 1
unavailable-subtitle: Not enough resources.
on-arrival: resources -= 1; moderate_strength += 2; conservative_strength += 2; liberal_strength += 1; europe_relations += 1; radical_dissent += 3; rural_rep += 3; rural_dem -= 2; freemen_rep += 1

By promoting cautious moderation in Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee, we hope to appeal to loyal Unionists and former Whigs. But this comes at a cost with more radical party elements.
