= Party Disunity

Internal conflict is tearing our party apart. With little agreement on goals or strategy, factions openly undermine each other, sabotaging our campaigns and weakening our message.

[? if radical_dissent > 30 : The radicals are increasingly confrontational toward the party establishment. ?]
[? if moderate_dissent > 30 : The moderates are frustrated at the party’s growing instability. ?]
[? if conservative_dissent > 30 : The conservatives argue that we’ve strayed too far from pragmatism. ?]
[? if liberal_dissent > 30: The liberals threaten to break with the party leadership. ?]

We must address these tensions before a split becomes inevitable.

@enforce_unity
title: Enforce party discipline.
on-arrival: radical_dissent -= 5; moderate_dissent -= 5; conservative_dissent -= 5; socialist_dissent -= 5; radical_strength -= 2; socialist_strength -= 2

We apply pressure across the board to restore order, but risk losing influence with key factions.

@concessions_radicals
title: Give concessions to the radicals.
view-if: radical_dissent > 30
on-arrival: radical_dissent -= 7; moderate_dissent += 4; conservative_dissent += 2

We adopt more radical rhetoric and promise bold reforms, at the risk of alienating more cautious voices.

@concessions_moderates
title: Give concessions to the moderates.
view-if: moderate_dissent > 30
on-arrival: moderate_dissent -= 7; radical_dissent += 3; socialist_dissent += 2

We moderate our tone and focus on achievable goals. The radicals and socialists aren't pleased.

@concessions_conservatives
title: Give concessions to the conservatives.
view-if: conservative_dissent > 30
on-arrival: conservative_dissent -= 7; radical_dissent += 3; moderate_dissent += 2

We promise more gradual reforms and traditional messaging, which angers radicals and centrists alike.

@concessions_liberals
title: Give concessions to the liberals
view-if: liberal_dissent > 30
on-arrival: liberal_dissent -= 7; radical_dissent += 4; moderate_dissent += 2

We incorporate more civil liberties and reformist policies to satisfy liberal demands, though some moderates and radicals may object.

@do_nothing
title: Let them argue it out.
on-arrival: radical_dissent += 1; moderate_dissent += 1; conservative_dissent += 1; socialist_dissent += 1

We allow internal debate to play out, hoping things will resolve naturally, but tensions rise.
