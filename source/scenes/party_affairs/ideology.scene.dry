= Questions of Ideology

Our party is divided among competing ideological visions for the future of the Republic. What path should we prioritise?

[? if ideology != 0 : We have previously chosen a [+ ideology +] ideology. Changing it will likely have drawbacks. ?]

- @radical_republican: Total equality, Southern reconstruction, and popular democracy must be pursued with vigour.
- @moderate_republican: A moderate course will restore national unity without further division.
- @labor_republican: The party must focus on workersâ€™ rights, land reform, and economic justice.
- @bourgeois_republican: Strengthening institutions, markets, and constitutional reform should guide us.
- @easy_discard

    Q.changed = 1;

Moderates hope to reconcile North and South with a more cautious approach, avoiding excess upheaval.

The republicans that support the workers emphasise the plight of Northern workers and freedmen alike, supporting job creation and land redistribution.

@bourgeois

    Q.changed = 1;
}

go-to: changed if changed = 1

Liberal conservatives prioritise economic stability and constitutional order.

@changed  
on-arrival: radical_dissent += 5; moderate_dissent += 5; conservative_dissent += 5; socialist_dissent += 5;

Changing ideological course has unsettled various factions.
