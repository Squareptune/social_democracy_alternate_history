= Questions of Ideology

Our party is divided among competing ideological visions for the future of the Republic. What path should we prioritise?

[? if ideology != 0 : We have previously chosen a [+ ideology +] ideology. Changing it will likely have drawbacks. ?]

- @radical_republican: Total equality, Southern reconstruction, and popular democracy must be pursued with vigour.
- @moderate_republican: A moderate course will restore national unity without further division.
- @conservative_republican: Preserve tradition and order, while slowly guiding the South toward reform.
- @liberal_republican: Support constitutionalism, institutions, and gradual liberal reforms.
- @easy_discard

Radical Republicans support full Reconstruction, racial equality, and a democratic revolution in the South.

Moderates hope to reconcile North and South with a more cautious approach, avoiding excess upheaval.

    Q.changed = 1;

Conservatives seek to preserve order and stability, prioritizing unity over rapid social transformation.

@liberal_republican

    Q.changed = 1;
}

go-to: changed if changed = 1
on-departure: ideology = "liberal"; liberal_strength += 10; liberal_dissent -= 5; conservative_dissent += 3; middle_class_rep += 3; moderate_dissent -= 2; radical_dissent += 2;

Liberals favor institutions, civil liberties, constitutional reforms, and a rules-based path to justice and equality.

Changing ideological course has unsettled various factions.
