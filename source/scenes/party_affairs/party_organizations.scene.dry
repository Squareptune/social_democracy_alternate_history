#subtitle: Outside of electoral politics, the Republican Party runs a social world.

= Party Organizations

Political parties in America are more than just electoral machines—they are hubs of civic activity. From newspapers and veterans’ groups to schools and aid societies, parties cultivate lasting influence through community institutions.

- @newspapers: Expand our party-affiliated press.
- @welfare: Fund mutual aid for workingmen and freedmen.
- @culture: Support educational and civic societies.
- @veterans: Fund Union veterans' groups and protect the loyal citizenry.
- @youth: Launch outreach to younger voters and apprentices.
- @nothing: Do not increase funding for any program.

go-to: media

We invest in loyal newspapers and pamphleteers to bolster our political messaging. As the saying goes: control the ink, control the narrative.

on-arrival: resources -= 1; freemen_rep += 3; unemployed_rep += 3; rural_rep += 1; radical_dissent -= 5;

Freedmen, veterans, and the poor look to us, not for handouts, but for dignity. Through local aid societies and the Freedmen’s Bureau, we renew their faith in our party and its promises.

Education, oration, and loyalist clubs provide spiritual glue in a nation torn by war. These civic efforts show that the Republican Party stands for more than elections—it stands for civilization.

on-arrival: resources -= 1; rural_rep += 2; freemen_rep += 2; conservative_dissent -= 3;

We bolster Union veterans’ lodges and black militias alike—groups that remain the last line of defense for Republican government in the South.

@youth

on-arrival: resources -= 1; youth_clubs += 1; radical_strength += 5; moderate_strength += 2; workers_rep += 2; radical_dissent -= 2;

When given purpose, young Republicans—apprentices, veterans, and civic-minded youth—flock to our cause. But this next generation often pushes for deeper Reconstruction and more radical change.

@nothing

We avoid funding any non-electoral Republican organizations at this time.

- @return: Continue...
