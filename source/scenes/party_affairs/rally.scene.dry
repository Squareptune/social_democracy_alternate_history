@dem_attack

A Democratic mob, possibly with Ku Klux Klan sympathizers, has attacked the Republican rally!

- @police_protect: Call the police to protect our rally.
- @cancel: Cancel the rally.

on-arrival: police_success = Us_police_loyalty * Us_police_militancy * Us_police_strength * 2 - kkk_strength * 1.5;
go-to: police_win if police_success >= 0; police_lose if police_success < 0

@police_win
go-to: main_rally

The police successfully protected the rally. The meeting can proceed as planned.

@police_lose
on-arrival: freemen_rep -= 3; workers_rep -= 2; radical_dissent += 4;

The police failed to secure the rally. The attackers broke it up, undermining our presence and terrifying our supporters.

@cancel
on-arrival: radical_dissent += 3; freemen_rep -= 2; unemployed_rep -= 1;

We chose to cancel the rally due to the threat of violence. While it may be the safer course, many supporters are disheartened.

@main_rally

Mass rallies are a key part of building up Republican support, especially among loyal Unionists and newly enfranchised voters. What is the main focus of this rally?

- @reconstruction: Uphold Reconstruction and protect the rights of Freedmen.
- @industry: Promote industrial growth and northern prosperity.
- @unity: Heal the Union while upholding Republican values.
- @law_order: Crack down on Klan violence and defend law and order.
- @local: Address specific concerns of the local population.
- @easy_discard

@reconstruction
on-arrival: freemen_rep += 5 * (1 - radical_dissent / 100); radical_strength += 3; conservative_dissent += 2;

We speak boldly in defense of Black rights and Reconstruction. This message rallies the freedmen and radical base, but risks alienating conservatives.

@industry
on-arrival: middle_class_rep += 4; workers_rep += 2; moderate_strength += 3;

Our focus on economic progress and industry appeals to the northern business class and industrial workers.

@unity
on-arrival: middle_class_rep += 2; rural_rep += 2; moderate_strength += 3; radical_dissent -= 2; conservative_dissent -= 2;

We emphasize national unity and healing, aiming to bring together former Unionists and moderates behind a stable Republican vision.

@law_order
on-arrival: rural_rep += 3; freemen_rep += 2; conservative_strength += 3; radical_dissent -= 1;

We condemn Klan terror and lawlessness. Our firm stance strengthens our image as the party of law and order.

@local
on-arrival: workers_rep += 2; unemployed_rep += 2; middle_class_rep += 1;

We tailor our message to the specific needs of the areaâ€”jobs, infrastructure, and fairness.
