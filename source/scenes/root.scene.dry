> *"While the workingmen, the true political powers of the North, allowed slavery to defile their own republic, while before the Negro, mastered and sold without his concurrence, they boasted it the highest prerogative of the white-skinned laborer to sell himself and choose his own master, they were unable to attain the true freedom of labor, or to support their European brethren in their struggle for emancipation; but this barrier to progress has been swept off by the red sea of civil war."*

 - Karl Marx, *Address of the International Working Men's Association to Abraham Lincoln*, 1865

This is a game of alternate history. While historical accuracy is a major concern, keep in mind that this is a *game*, and that any divergence from actual events will necessarily have to involve some element of make-believe. Nevertheless, please let the author know if there are any glaring mistakes.

For more information on the politics of Reconstruction, see the "Library" page on the top left. If this is your first time playing the game, it is strongly recommended that you read at least some of this information.

= 1865

The Civil War is approaching an end, and we are thinking about the future. Though the wounds of war run deep, the nation begins to rebuild. The economy in the North is poised for expansion, and the promise of freedom brings new possibilities for millions. In foreign affairs, the United States stands united once more, and with peace restored, we look to the future with cautious optimism.

Now, the task of the Republican Party is to prepare for the next phase of Reconstruction. The Democratic opposition, long tied to the cause of secession and slavery, is discredited in the eyes of many. With President Lincoln's legacy and the Union victory behind us, we stand to shape the future. Perhaps the next Congress will bring a stronger majority to secure full rights and citizenship for the freedmen.
