"The Negro voter ... had, then, but one clear economic ideal and that was his demand for land, his demand that the great plantations be subdivided and given to him as his right. This was a perfectly fair and natural demand and ought to have been an integral part of Emancipation. To emancipate four million laborers whose labor had been owned, and separate them from the land upon which they had worked for nearly two and a half centuries, was an operation such as no modern country had for a moment attempted or contemplated. The German and English and French serf, the Italian and Russian serf, were, on emancipation, given definite rights in the land. Only the American Negro slave was emancipated without such rights and in the end this spelled for him the continuation of slavery."

This is a game of alternate history. While historical accuracy is a major concern, keep in mind that this is a *game*, and that any divergence from actual events will necessarily have to involve some element of make-believe. Nevertheless, please let the author know if there are any glaring mistakes.

For more information on the politics of Reconstruction, see the "Library" page on the top left. If this is your first time playing the game, it is strongly recommended that you read at least some of this information.

= 1865

The Civil War is approaching an end, and we are thinking about the future. Though the wounds of war run deep, the nation begins to rebuild. The economy in the North is poised for expansion, and the promise of freedom brings new possibilities for millions. In foreign affairs, the United States stands united once more, and with peace restored, we look to the future with cautious optimism.

Now, the Republican Party's task is to prepare for the next phase of Reconstruction. The Democratic opposition, long tied to the cause of secession and slavery, is discredited in the eyes of many. With President Lincoln's legacy and the Union victory behind us, we stand to shape the future. Perhaps the next Congress will bring a stronger majority to secure full rights and citizenship for the freedmen.
